->To finish an activity call: 
                 activity_name.this.finish();


->When finish method is called the successive method calls are:
       *onPause(), *onStop(), *onDestroy().


->Set image scaleType=centerCrop to remove space between horizontal image viewes.


->In manifest file inside the activity tag set following to fix the screenOrientation:   
            android:screenOrientation=" "


->Manifest inside activity tag set following to take action when screenOrientation change
  and override the method: onConfigurationChanged() in the java file for activity.           
            android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize"


->After clicking the app icon method calls are:
      *onCreate(), *onStart(), *onResume().


->When we minimize current activity or go from first to second activity the methods of 
  current or first activity called: 
                                  *onPause(), *onStop().
  That means when current activity is minimized or we are in second activity the first or
  current activity is sopped but not destroyed. 
                       

->If we come back to first activity by pressing back from the second activity or a minimized 
  activity is relaunched then following methods of first or relaunced activity is called:
      *onRestart(), *onStart(), *onResume().
  

->When back batton is pressed from an activity then it is destroyed that is following methods
  are called: *onPause->onStop->onDestroy. 
  That means pressing back button calls finish() which calls those methods.In this case we
  can not save state or information.


->When an special activity(theme.dialog) that appears like an AlertDialog is launched
  then called method is: *onPause()
  After disappearing the alertDialog: *onResume(), is called.


->If screen orientation is changed then method calls are:
     *Pause->Stop->Destroy->Create->Start->Resume


->Once system automatically recreates activity after destroying it(Ex.Orientation changed)
  after onStart(),onRestoreInstanceState() is called.
  onRestoreInstance() and onCreate() receives the same Bundle that means we can use 
  onCreate() instead of this method.
  After onPause(), onSavedInstance() is called.
